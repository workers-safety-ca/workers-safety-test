+++
Marked annually in Canada on April 28th, the National Day of Mourning is dedicated to remembering those who have lost their lives, or suffered injury or illness on the job or due to a work-related tragedy.

The observance of this day is meant to honour the lives of workers lost, but it is also a call to protect the living and make the world of work a safer place. We must continue to commit to safe and healthy conditions in the workplace to prevent further injuries, illnesses, and deaths.

On Wednesday, April 28, 2021, the Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic welcome all to reflect on this year's National Day of Mourning.
