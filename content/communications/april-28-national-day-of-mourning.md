+++
Marked annually in Canada on April 28, the National Day of Mourning is dedicated to remembering those who have lost their lives, or suffered injury or illness on the job or due to a work-related tragedy.

We hope the annual observance of this day will help:

strengthen the resolve to establish safe and healthy conditions in the workplace, prevent further injuries, illnesses, and deaths. 

As much as this is a day to remember the dead, it is also a call to protect the living and make work a place to thrive.

Pause. Reflect. Remember. Renew.

At 11 a.m., we will honour workers who have died, were injured, or became ill from their job, and will renew our commitment to health and safety in the workplace.

We welcome all to reflect on this year's National Day of Mourning - Wednesday April 28, 2021.
