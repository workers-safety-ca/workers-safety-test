## **Warm up from the cold!**

The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic hosted a reception thanking the participants of this year's demonstration held on December 12, 2016.

To wrap up the injured workers' rallies held at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board and the Ombudsman's Office in Toronto, our Clinic welcomed demo participants to our office located at 180 Dundas Street West in Toronto. Demonstrators got out of the cold and enjoyed good food and cheer. Injured workers and community partners socialized and warmed up with pizza, hot chocolate and some sugary treats.

Our Clinic extends its thanks to all the hard work that went into the planning and successful execution of the 2016 Demo Tour.
