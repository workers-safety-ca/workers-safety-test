**Warm up from the cold!**  

To wrap up the Demo Tour, the Workersâ€™ Health and Safety Legal Clinic welcomed the December 12th demo participants to their office located in Toronto. Demonstrators got out of the cold and enjoyed good food and cheer. Injured workers and community partners socialized and warmed up with pizza, hot chocolate and some sugary treats.

The Clinic extends its thanks to all the hard work that went into the planning and successful execution of the 2016 Demo Tour.
