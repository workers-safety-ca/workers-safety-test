**Injured workers call for change in workers' compensation!**  

Injured workers and their allies continued the December 12th rally at the Ombudsman’s office located at 483 Bay Street in Toronto. A letter voicing the inadequacies with the Workers Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) was delivered to a representative of Ontario’s Ombudsman, Mr. J. Paul Dubé, to request that an investigation be made into the continued austerity practices of the WSIB.

The injured workers community has strong concerns about recent practices and developments at the WSIB. Although premiums have gone down for employers, injured workers continue to experience less compensation benefits from the WSIB
