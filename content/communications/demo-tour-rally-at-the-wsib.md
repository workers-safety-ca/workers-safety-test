Injured workers deserve to receive fair compensation!

Injured workers, advocates, union members and worker groups united on December 12, 2016, for the annual call to action against austerity measures that have been taken by the Workers Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). The rally began at the WSIB’s Toronto office located at 200 Front Street West.

Across Ontario, injured workers are under attack; the WSIB, instead of seeking to support workers in their recovery from injury and illness, are cutting injured workers’ benefits. The WSIB is ignoring doctors’ recommendations and denying workers the time to heal by restricting worker compensation benefits. The WSIB is forcing injured workers to return to work in order to save money for itself and the employers it insures.
