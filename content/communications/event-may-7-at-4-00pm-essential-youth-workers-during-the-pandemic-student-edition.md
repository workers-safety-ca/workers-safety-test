Are you an essential worker during the COVID-19 Pandemic? Want to know more about how to protect yourself while working?

Student and youth workers fill many of the jobs that have been deemed “essential” during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grocery and convenience store employees, take-out restaurant workers, food couriers and Uber drivers in the gig economy are working on the front-lines, often in low-wage and precarious jobs. Workers in retail establishments have reported that measures by employers to protect employees and customers have been inconsistent. Food couriers, ride-share drivers, and other gig economy workers continue to have limited access to employment protections and benefits. Pandemic pay has been provided to some workers, but is this enough to compensate for the risks of continuing to work?

Join us to hear from legal and labour advocates and learn about the conditions that “essential workers” are facing during the pandemic, and how they can exercise their rights to stay safe while working.
