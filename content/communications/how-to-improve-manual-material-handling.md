+++
The Worker's Health and Safety Legal Clinic continued its partnership with first year engineering students at the University of Toronto by participating in U of T Engineering Strategies & Practice Course, and the Multidisciplinary Capstone Design Course.

Proposed by Clinic volunteer, Edward Liu, this year's project looked to address one of the most common injuries in the workplace - lower back pain. Statistics show that almost 1 in 4 workers will experience some form of injury because of repeated lifting and transporting of materials. Currently, there is no solution that eliminates or directly minimizes the risk of of work-related injury where users must have the loads carried exclusively on their person.

To improve the manual package handling of loads of up to 25 kg, the students developed a Weight Redistributing Harness. This design would help the redistribution of weight away from the worker's lower back.
