+++
On June 1st every year, injured workers and labour activists gather outside the Legislative Assembly at Queen’s Park in Toronto and in cities across the province to mark Injured Workers’ Day. 

Ontarians pay respect to the hundreds of workers who have died or become injured while working on their job sites. The Ontario Injured Workers Day is an opportunity to recognize the individuals who have suffered injuries and fatalities as a result of their workplace conditions.

We also rally on this day to celebrate the gains made through united action, raise current concerns – and remind governments we cannot be ignored.

Because of COVID-19, the 2021 May 31st Vigil and June 1st events will again be held online. 

Please [check here for details](https://injuredworkersonline.org/iwevents/event/june-1st-injured-workers-day/) on how you can join in.
