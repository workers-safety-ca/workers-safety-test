+++
On June 1st every year, injured workers, labour activists and their allies gather outside the Legislative Assembly at Queen’s Park in Toronto and in cities across the province to mark Injured Workers’ Day. Ontarians pay respect to the hundreds of workers who have lost their lives or been seriously injured as a result of hazardous workplaces.

Injured Workers' Day is an opportunity to recognize the individuals who have suffered injuries and fatalities as a result of their workplace conditions, but it is also a time to rally and celebrate the gains made through united action, raise current concerns and remind governments workers rights cannot be ignored.

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly reduced the access to services and community supports for our most vulnerable workers like those in essential services - unable to work from home and live in communities that face a higher likeliness to exposure to COVID-19 .  

This year's May 31st **Injured Workers Vigil**, and June 1st **Injured Workers' Day** events will again be held online because of COVID-19. Please [check here for details](https://injuredworkersonline.org/iwevents/event/june-1st-injured-workers-day/) on how you can join in, or review the event details below.
