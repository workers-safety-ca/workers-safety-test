Despite the epidemic of precarious, unsafe, and toxic work, the Workers' Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) is more concerned with its own bottom line than with protecting the well-being of injured workers in Ontario.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 1rem;">Join us on the streets!</span>
