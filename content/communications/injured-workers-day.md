### Workers' Compensation is a Right! Injured Workers' Day Rally and March.

Despite the epidemic of precarious, unsafe, and toxic work, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) is more concerned with its own bottom line than with protecting the well-being of injured workers in Ontario.

We need to come together and demand our right to workers' compensation.

Join us on the streets!

**June 1st , 2017 --- 11:30am - at Queen’s Park.**
