Injured workers, advocates, union members and allies rallied in Toronto on December 12th, for the annual call to action against austerity measures that have been taken by the Workers Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB).

The rally began at the WSIB’s Toronto office located at 200 Front Street West and then continued at the Ombudsman’s office located at 483 Bay Street. A letter voicing concerns with the WSIB was delivered to a representative of Ontario’s Ombudsman, Mr. J. Paul Dubé, to request that an investigation be made into the practices of the WSIB.

To wrap up the demonstration, the Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic (WHSLC) welcomed the participants to their office located at 180 Dundas Street. Injured workers and community partners socialized and warmed up with pizza, hot chocolate and some sugary treats.
