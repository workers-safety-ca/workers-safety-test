+++
The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic ("the Clinic") is a community legal aid clinic funded by Legal Aid Ontario. Our mandate is to provide legal advice and representation to non-unionized low wage workers in Ontario who face health and safety problems at work. 

In response to the proposed **_Bill 27 - Working for Workers Act, 2021_**, the aim of our Clinic's submissions is to speak to those specific parts of Bill 27 that we have expertise on, and, to wherever possible, not duplicate the helpful submissions of our colleagues in other legal clinics and in the injured workers community.
