+++
On May 6th, the Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic wrote a letter to Minister McNaughton to urge the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development (MOL) to better support non-unionized essential workers who are experiencing unsafe working conditions due to COVID 19. The MOL plays an important role in enforcing the OHSA with a view to preventing the spread of COVID-19 at Ontario workplaces. 

There are many non-union low wage workers in factories, retail, and other sectors who, due to the very real prospect of being fired, will not stage work refusals or make complaints to authorities. On behalf of these workers in all essential services, the clinic requests that the MOL send inspectors, with full PPE protection, to workplaces where OHSA conventions are alleged with a view to writing orders under 25(2) (h) where the OHSA lacks a specific provision addressing the health and safety concern.
