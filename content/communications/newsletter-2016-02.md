## The effect of the Kazenelson criminal law decision on legal advice to workers.

Kazenelson is the first major conviction under the Westray-changed Criminal Code. On 11 January 2016, he was sentenced to 3Â½ years in prison; that sentence is being appealed. It was a contested criminal trial, as distinct from a trial under the Occupational Health & Safety Act.

The Kazenelson case,
has created a precedent that changes in the way workers can be prosecuted. Not so much that the law has changed (which it has, somewhat, but not too much), nor that Kazenelson has perversely interpreted that law (it has not), but simply because it initiates criminalization of workplace procedure as a practical precedent.
