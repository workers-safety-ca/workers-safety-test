## **U of T Engineering Students’ proposal for _Ontario Building Code_ changes for Radon Gas**

According to the World Health Organization, radon gas has become the second leading cause of lung cancer. In Ontario, high levels of radon can be found within Toronto’s GTA. Since there are no legal requirements in Ontario for radon testing, the current _Ontario Building Code_ is inadequate to handle radon as a rising problem.

The Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) issued a report in November 2014 called _[Radon in Homes, Schools, and Workplaces: CELA Finds Legal Protections Lacking](http://www.cela.ca/newsevents/radon-homes-schools-and-workplaces-cela-finds-legal-protections-lacking)_. The concerns raised by this report inspired our Clinic to suggest this topic as a project for fourth year engineering students at the University of Toronto.
