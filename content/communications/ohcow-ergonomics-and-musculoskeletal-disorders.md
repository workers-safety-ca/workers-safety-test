# **OHCOW Ergonomic Services and other MSD Resources**

At work, we can all suffer from occasional pain and discomfort, but in general work should not hurt.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most common type of workplace injury in Ontario workplaces. Musculoskeletal disorders at work is an umbrella term for a number of injuries and disorders of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, bone and nerves.

Studies have shown that physical factors in the workplace, how work is organized and the specific tools used at work can increase a person’s chance of developing MSD. 

Some employers ignore the strong contribution of the workplace and blame workers’ low back or shoulder pain on individual factors (e.g. gardening, susceptibility or genetics). 

The aim of ergonomics is to match the job to the worker to reduce the strain placed on the tissues and to prevent injury. 

It is crucial to control the hazards that could leads to MSDs. The **Occupational Health Clinics for Ontario Workers (OHCOW)** provide ergonomic services and supports ensuring that workers are working safely and effectively.
