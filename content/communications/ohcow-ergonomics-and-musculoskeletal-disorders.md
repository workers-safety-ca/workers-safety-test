At work, we can all suffer from occasional pain and discomfort, but in general work should not hurt.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most common type of workplace injury in Ontario workplaces. "Musculoskeletal disorders" is an umbrella term for a number of injuries and disorders of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, bone and nerves.

Studies have shown that physical factors in the workplace - how work is organized and the specific tools used as part of that work - can increase a person’s chance of developing a musculoskeletal disorder.

Some employers ignore the role of the workplace in such injuries, and instead blame workers’ low back or shoulder pain on individual factors (e.g. gardening, susceptibility or genetics).

The aim of ergonomics is to match the job to the worker in order to reduce the strain placed on the tissues, muscles and bones, and to prevent injury.

It is crucial to control the hazards that could leads to MSDs. The **Occupational Health Clinics for Ontario Workers (OHCOW)** provides ergonomic services and supports ensuring that workers are working safely and effectively.
