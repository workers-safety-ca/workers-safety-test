## The Project
“Operation Rainbow” is a project proposed by **Dr. Michael Grossman ­ a volunteer for Workers’
Health and Safety Legal Aid Clinic**. It deals with the Rainbow experiment: a laboratory
experiment performed in secondary schools that identifies characteristic colours produced by
crystalline compounds when ignited.

## The Proposal
However, the experiment uses methanol as an accelerant. Due to its high combustibility and low
evaporation temperature the methanol creates a serious fire hazard. Various accounts of injuries
caused by flash fires have led the American Chemical Society to recommend a discontinuation of
the experiment. Thus the aim is to create a design that makes the experiment safe.
