+++
The Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic continued its partnership engineering students at the University of Toronto by participating in U of T Engineering Strategies & Practice Course, and the 2020-2021 Multidisciplinary Capstone Design Course.

This year’s project looked to address one of the most pressing concerns faced by workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic - Indoor Air Quality.

Undetected poor indoor air quality is a leading factor of respiratory health risks in workplaces in Ontario. The current regulated air quality monitoring procedures are expensive and labour intensive. As a result air quality testings are often not performed until incidents and injuries occur. This places workers’ health and safety at risk.

The Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic requested this year's team to develop a preliminary method of identifying potential air contaminant accumulation zones that would inform employers whether further investigation is required.

The goal of the project was to develop a low-cost software simulation of the flow of air contaminants in workplaces for users with no simulation experience.
