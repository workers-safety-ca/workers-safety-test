title = "U of T Capstone Project: Airflow Prediction Simulation Software. "

+++
The Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic continued its partnership with first year engineering students at the University of Toronto by participating in U of T Engineering Strategies & Practice Course, and the 2020-2021 Multidisciplinary Capstone Design Course.

This year’s project looked to address one of the most pressing concerns faced by workplaces during this COVID-19 pandemic - Indoor Air Quality.

Undetected poor indoor air quality is a leading factor of respiratory health risks in workplaces in Ontario. The current air quality monitoring procedures are expensive and labour intensive. As a result, air quality testings are often not performed until incidents occur, placing workers’ health and safety at risk. 

Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic, a non-profit organization that promotes workers’ health and safety, requested a preliminary method of identifying potential air contaminant accumulation zones that would inform employers whether further investigation is required. 

The goal of the project is to develop a low-cost software simulation of the flow of air contaminants in workplaces for users with no simulation experience.
