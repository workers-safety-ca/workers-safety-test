+++
The Supreme Court of Canada released the decision in _Uber Technologies Inc. v. Heller._ The Clinic was one of several intervenors in the matter to raise the issue of the need to protect statutory minimums for workers.

Many tech companies like Uber are providing employment to people, but have little interest in the responsibility of providing their workers with the minimum standards for working conditions.

Mr. Heller was a driver for Uber who started a class action against the company. Of interest to the Clinic was the seeking of recognition of being Uber’s employees and the ability to exercise the rights under the _Employment Standards Act_. Uber argued that any disputes were to be resolved through arbitration and that the class action should be stayed.

The Clinic’s intervention raised with the Court the need for statutory minimums. The _Employment Standards Act_, the _Workplace Safety and Insurance Act_, and the _Occupational Health and Safety Act_ all provide protection to workers. Employers cannot force workers to contract out of their rights by making everyone agree that they are “independent operators”.

The Court rejected Uber’s appeal. The Court found that the requirements of the arbitration terms were unconscionable. Given that the arbitration requirement was not valid, the class action could continue. The Court did not address the question of the applicability of the _Employment Standards Act_.
