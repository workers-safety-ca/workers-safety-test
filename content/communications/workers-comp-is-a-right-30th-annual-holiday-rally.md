On December 14th at 10am, join injured workers for the **30th anniversary of the Christmas Demonstration.** The theme this year: 

### **Fighting back against more gifts to employers – nothing for injured and ill workers**.

  
This year, **Ontario Network of Injured Workers Groups (ONIWG)** is holding a community forum at **10am** to hear from injured workers. It’s time for the provincial government to listen to injured workers. At **11am**, we will hear from allies fighting for injured workers in the Labour movement, and those battling for migrant workers’ rights, occupational disease coverage, and more. We will also have some festive performances from injured workers themselves.

More details on the forum, the speakers, and the performances will be available at the following [facebook event](https://webmail.lao.on.ca/owa/redir.aspx?C=gpdt9ncJLxVR4hdo1kdNcysbLmpzTpCYDrCyB9jEaWh9y6MFGrzZCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2finjuredworkersonline.us16.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3dec4d4619ec66582e5c7c860b4%26id%3d38f92e97fd%26e%3dac8cb886d7) page. Please join the event and invite your friends, and share our flyer on your social media.
