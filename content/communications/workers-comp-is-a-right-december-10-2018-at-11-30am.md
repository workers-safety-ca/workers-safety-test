This year, the conservative government and WSIB have been the Grinch trying to steal workers’ compensation. They’ve teamed up to give employers a $1.5 billion gift, in the form of a massive reduction to their premium rates – that’s the money that’s needed to provide compensation for people who need it. Meanwhile, injured workers are struggling with poverty and homelessness.
