## ¡Buena Paga!

### "Well Paid!”

<hr>

“¡Buena Paga!” radio program began on June 3, 2017 on Voces Latinas, a radio station that broadcasts shows in Spanish for the Hispanic community in the GTA area. The weekly hour-long show provides a platform to discuss common employment and health and safety issues facing Spanish-Speaking undocumented workers. Each week, the program focuses on a new topic featuring a guest speaker and case scenarios. People calling in bring their own experiences and knowledge to the discussion.
