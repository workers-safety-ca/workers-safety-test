¡Buena Paga!

“Well Paid!”

¡Buena Paga! radio program began on June 3, 2017 on Voces Latinas, a radio station that broadcasts shows for the Hispanic community in the GTA. The hour-long show provides a platform to discuss common employment and health and safety issues facing Spanish-Speaking undocumented workers.

Each week, the program focuses on a new topic featuring a guest speaker and case scenarios. People calling in bring their own experiences and knowledge to the discussion.
