## El Cafecito

### “The Little Coffee Shop”

<hr>

On the last Thursday of each month, the Center for Spanish Speaking Peoples (CSSP) hosts a gathering place for workers.

Launched on July 27, 2017, El Cafecito provides a café-like experience where workers are invited to stop by for a cup of coffee and to chat, sing karaoke and listen to live music shows for free. While this initiative welcomes all workers, it is specifically designed to be a friendly space for Spanish-speaking workers who often struggle to find places where they can feel safe and share their experiences and concerns.

Join us at the next El Cafecito on Thursday, September 7, 2017 from 6:00pm to 9:00pm at  CSSP located in Toronto at 2141 Jane Street, Room 100 [[map]](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/2141+Jane+St+%23100,+North+York,+ON+M3M+1A2/@43.7203147,-79.5103707,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x882b3104f35472ed:0xe119211bc2cab608!2s2141+Jane+St+%23100,+North+York,+ON+M3M+1A2!3b1!8m2!3d43.7203147!4d-79.508182!3m4!1s0x882b3104f35472ed:0xe119211bc2cab608!8m2!3d43.7203147!4d-79.508182).
