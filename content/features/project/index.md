Undocumented workers in Ontario are more likely to take physically demanding jobs for less than minimum wage, and are more often exposed to hazards that cause accidents and injuries.

The Centre for Spanish Speaking Peoples and the Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic continue our joint two year initiative to prevent health and safety injuries among Spanish-speaking undocumented and non-status workers. Julio Díaz is the lawyer leading this project’s development.

Since early spring, we have participated in numerous demonstrations, cultural events and community fairs, and we have outreached through workshops and presentations.

We are pleased to announce two interactive initiatives that have been created to further connect with the Spanish-speaking community:
