# Public Legal Education

The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic (WHSLC) has developed a strong focus on public legal education by way of oral presentations and workshops to community agencies, schools, job connection programs, apprenticeship programs and employment readiness programs such as Enhanced Language Training.

Our Community Legal Workers travel all over the City of Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area to inform youth, job seekers and newcomers about employment rights as well as health and safety rights at work. We serve as a resource to many vulnerable groups and are often part of a newcomer’s or youth’s first introduction to Ontario’s employment laws and Legal Aid Ontario's clinic system.

These workshops provide the public with legal information regarding employment standards, occupational health and safety, human rights and the legal aid system. We facilitate workshops in person and provide printed materials and resources to the participants.

If you are interested in booking a workshop, please [Contact Us](/contact/).
