## Employment and Disability

We represent workers who are dismissed from work because of a disability or because they asked for accommodation or a change in work duties due to a disability. We have acted for workers who lose their jobs simply for having an injury at work for which Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) benefits were claimed.
