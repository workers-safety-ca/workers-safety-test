## Wrongful Dismissal and Constructive Dismissal Lawsuits

We file lawsuits against employers and represent workers who are wrongfully dismissed or laid off without proper notice or pay _in lieu_ (instead) of notice.

Additionally, if there is a fundamental change to working conditions that leave a worker with no option but to quit, we can represent workers in a lawsuit against the employer based on constructive dismissal.
