### Wrongful Dismissal and Constructive Dismissal Lawsuits

The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic files lawsuits against employers and represents workers who are wrongfully dismissed or laid off without proper notice or pay _in lieu_ (instead) of notice. Additionally, if there is a fundamental change to working conditions that leave a worker with no option but to quit, we can represent workers in a lawsuit against the employer based on constructive dismissal.
