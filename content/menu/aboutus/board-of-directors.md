The Workers' Health and Safety Legal Clinic (WHSLC) is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors elected by our membership. Our Board members come from a variety of backgrounds and share a common interest in employment-related and health and safety issues from the worker perspective. Currently, many of our Board members have had experience with health and safety issues at work or were injured in the workplace.

Being a volunteer Board member is an opportunity to network, to meet others who share your commitment, and to enrich your own skills, knowledge and experience. While no particular legal experience is required, our Board strives to have members with a variety of experience and knowledge.

Board members must be WHSLC [members](/menu/member/) and must sign our Confidentiality Statement. Board members are elected for two-year terms and also participate on Board committees.

If you are interested in our Board of Directors, please [contact us](/menu/contact/).
