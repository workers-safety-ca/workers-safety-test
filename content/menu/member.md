## **Become a Member!**

The WHSLC is supported by a diverse membership. Our primary goal is to provide free legal services to non-unionized workers experiencing employment issues and/or health and safety legal issues in Ontario. To help us ensure that our services are relevant, we need the participation of people experiencing workplace injustices in Ontario, as well as those who are serving vulnerable workers who experience unfair workplace practices.

Please consider becoming a member and sharing your voice in the fight for improved health and safety as well as employment standards in Ontario’s workplaces. WHSLC membership is free and includes such benefits as receiving our newsletter and mailings, voting privileges at our Annual General Meeting, and the right to stand for election to our volunteer Board of Directors. For more information on our Board of Directors, visit the [About Us](/menu/about-us/) section on our website.

To become a member, you must be a resident of Ontario who is 18 years of age or older, and you must agree with our **Mission Statement** outlined below. Membership takes effect once our Board of Directors approves the application. The Clinic reserves the right to deny membership.

### Mission Statement

The Workers’ Health and Safety Legal Clinic (WHSLC) is committed to the promotion of safe and healthy workplaces throughout Ontario with a focus on the non-unionized sector of the workforce. We seek to do this by informing workers of their basic legal rights at work in the areas of health and safety, workers’ compensation, human rights and employment standards as well as legal advice and representation to non-unionized workers attempting to improve conditions in their individual workplaces. In particular, we provide representation to workers who have been unlawfully punished or terminated for exercising their rights.

On a broader scale, we work independently and with other like-minded groups, agencies and organizations to advocate for the enactment of improved standards affecting workplace health and safety and employment rights.
